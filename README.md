# Web App Boilerplate

<!-- [![N|Solid](https://cldup.com/dTxpPi9lDf.thumb.png)](https://nodesource.com/products/nsolid) -->

I built this boilerplate to use for future web app projects.  The quickstart projects you can get with the Angular CLI work fine, but I wanted something more my own.  I hope you'll find it useful :)

The project contains the following:
  - [Angular 5](https://angular.io/)
  - [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
  - [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
  - [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/3.2.1/examples/#)
  - [Ava](https://github.com/avajs/ava)
