# Web App Boilerplate

[![N|Solid](https://cldup.com/dTxpPi9lDf.thumb.png)](https://nodesource.com/products/nsolid)

I built this boilerplate to use for future web app projects.  The quickstart projects you can get with the Angular CLI work fine, but I wanted something more my own.  I hope you'll find it useful :)

The project contains the following:
  - Angular 5
  - Typescript
  - Webpack
  - Bootstrap and Font Awesome
  - Ava
